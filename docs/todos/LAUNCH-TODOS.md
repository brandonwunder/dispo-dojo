# Pre-Launch To-Do List

A running list of integrations and tasks to complete before full launch.

---

## Go High Level (GHL) Integration

- [ ] Connect GHL account + get API key
- [ ] Create "Waitlist Activated" email template in GHL
- [ ] Create "Waitlist Activated" SMS template in GHL
- [ ] Build GHL contact creation trigger (fires when user signs up → waitlisted)
- [ ] Build GHL automation: when admin activates a batch → fire email + SMS to each activated user
- [ ] Test end-to-end: signup → waitlist → admin approves batch → GHL sends email + SMS

**Context:** We cap signups at 25/week. People who sign up past the cap go on a waitlist with a visible position number. When the admin activates the next batch of 25 from the admin panel, GHL should fire personalized email + SMS: "Your Dispo Dojo account has been activated — welcome to the dojo."
